I have included all parts within the main.
But I have also created 2 separate .h files and .cpp fails besides main.cpp.
The .h files contain the declartion of classes with functions used to complete
parts 1, 2 and 3.

matrixfunctions.cpp contain functions associated with matrix.
homeworkparts.cpp separates each part of the homework into its own function.
main.cpp controls the flow of the program by letting you chose which 
part you want to use with additional options. 

To complie you can use the Makefile by simply typing
make
and to remove the files that were created you simply type
make clean and it iwll remove the executable and .o files.
